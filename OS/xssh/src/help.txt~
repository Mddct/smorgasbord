This shell implements many features found in higher performance shells.
However, it only implements certain features, with the emphasis on learning rather than performance.

Use other manual pages for exact command syntax and bug reports.

A full list of builtin commands is as follows:

echo [word ...] 
quit [status] 
set [variable [value]] 
unset [variable ...] 
wait pid 
cd [path]
chdir [path] 
pwd
why [question...]
manual command

External commands can also be used and are explained in further detail under the exec manual page.

Additional features about XSSH can be discovered by reading the xssh manual page.
