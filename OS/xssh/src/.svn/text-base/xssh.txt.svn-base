NAME
	XSSH

SYNOPSIS
	xssh [-x] [-d level] [file [arg] â€¦]

DESCRIPTION
	xssh (an Xtra Simple SHell) is a lightweight shell similar to bash, csh, or tcsh, but lacking many advanced features.
	
	-x
	Display the command line after variable substitution but before it is evaluated.
	
	-d level
	Set the debugging level to level. A debug level of 0 will not output any debug messages while 1 will output enough information to verify the correctness of the operation.
	The extent of that information is left to the implementation.
	Additional debug levels may be implemented beyond 0 and 1; however, those two debug levels are required to function as described above.
	
	file arg ...
	If a file is given, it is treated as an xssh script and input is taken from the file instead of stdin.
	Each additional argument after the filename is treated as an argument to that script and assigned to the positional variables $1, $2, etc. (see VARIABLES, below).

	After xssh has completed executing commands in file (or a syntax error is encountered), it must do one of two things:
	Quit if it encounters a quit command in the file.
	Otherwise, prompt for additional commands from standard input as if no file argument was given. 

RETURN VALUE
	Exit values are returned, either user specified or the exit value of the last foreground process.	
	
BUGS
	Pipelining hasn't been fully tested.
	Positional variables are occasionally sketchy.
