NAME
	set

SYNOPSIS
	set [variable [value]] 
	
DESCRIPTION
	When run with no arguments, display a list of all environment variables and their values.
	Otherwise set variable to value or the empty string if value is not given.
	XSSH should follow standard variable naming conventions for syntax-checking variable (see VARIABLES for more details).
    
	Note that some environment implementations may be more lax than this standard;
	if XSSH conforms to these specifications, it must also allow variable names to exist that do not follow this specification.
	(i.e. XSSH may not alter or unset nonconformant variables)

RETURN VALUE

BUGS
	Only accepts single values.  Not sure if this is a bug or not, but set $H Hello World only sets $H to Hello.
