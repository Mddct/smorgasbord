NAME
	echo

SYNOPSIS
	echo [word â€¦]

DESCRIPTION
    Display each word separated by a space. Append a newline to the end of output.
    Note that echo is not required to support advanced text or pattern matching features; 
    namely, it does not have to handle quoted strings, escaped characters, or multiline input.
    Furthermore, echo is not required to preserve additional whitespace;
    multiple spaces in a row may be reduced to a single space.
