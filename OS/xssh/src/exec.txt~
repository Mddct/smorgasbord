NAME
	exec

SYNOPSIS
	./external [&]

DESCRIPTION
	If xssh cannot identify a matching builtin for a command, it attempts to locate an external program matching the command. This matching should proceed as follows:
	If the command name is a path (i.e., contains a forward slash, /), xssh attempts to locate the file indicated by the path.
	If the command name begins with a forward slash, the path is taken to be absolute and shall be used as the full path to the executable.
	If the command name does not begin with a forward slash, the path is taken to be relative to the current working directory. 
	The executable's path is taken to be the given path appended to the current directory. 
	If the command name is not a path, xssh shall search the paths given in the PATH environment variable, in order, for a directory which directly contains the given executable name.
	If such a match is found, searching shall stop immediately and execution will proceed with the found executable. 
	If xssh cannot find an executable for the given command by following the above rules, it should print an error message and must cancel execution of the given command. 
	
	Externals can be backgrounded by using the & after the command.
	
RETURN VALUE
	Values returned from external command.
