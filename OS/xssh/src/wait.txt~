NAME
	wait

SYNOPSIS
	wait pid 

DESCRIPTION
	Wait for the child process pid to complete.
	If pid is -1, wait for any child process to complete.
	If pid is 0, wait for all child processes to complete.
	If xssh has not spawned a background process with PID pid or that process has already completed, return immediately.
	Note that xssh is only responsible for waiting on its own children; it does not have to implement wait for arbitrary PIDs.
