Mike McDonald's Code Samples
===========

Here are some various code samples from projects that I've worked on during my time in college. For students who may be taking these classes now or in the future, feel free to use my code as reference, but make sure that you 1) don't copy it verbatim and 2) cite it as a reference.

Here is a listing of the current directories:
1. Crypto
2. Embedded
3. Mobile
4. Parallel

## Crypto
Crypto contains DES and SHA-1 implementations in C++, as well as some Java code for some simple substitution ciphers.

## Embedded
Embedded contains some hardware (an 8x8 RGB LED Matrix Coffee Table controller board and some pictures of the finished product) as well as some software running on the Motorola 68HCS12 (even a bit of assembly).

## Mobile
Mobile contains my first "project" in Android development, which needs some serious UI love. Hopefully I'll get some iOS source as well.

## Parallel
Parallel contains C++ w/MPI and CUDA code for doing various cool things, including a full linear solver in parallel!

## TeX Templates
Here are a few useful TeX templates that I use on a daily basis: A TeX Memo class and a RH Homework Template. My resume template will be posted soon.
